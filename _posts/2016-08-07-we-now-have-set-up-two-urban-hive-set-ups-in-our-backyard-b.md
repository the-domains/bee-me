We now have set up two urban hive set-ups in our backyard. Being late in the season we started off by buying two separate colonies with 10 full frames each. Each hive was inspected for healthy comb, brood, and honey. Both hives have distinct personalities.

The Wood hive is full of workers. Begins bearding early evening. This hive clearly is warmer due to more bees and has a screened top and bottom board.

The White hive has much more traffic in and out its entrance for the smaller number of actual workers.

Two days ago a Mite Check was performed on both hives after using a stick board for three days.

The Wood hive averages 6.7 mites a day. This is clearly an acceptable range for this size hive.

The White hive averages 33.3 a day. This is an acceptable range for this size hive. However being smaller number wise it will be important to monitor the bees to insure these numbers do not grow.

Each night one to three (never more) bees can be found crawling about 5-7 feet away from the hive. These bees are no longer flying and will surely die. MY research leads me to believe this is due to tracheal mites. I will use honey B Healthy as a drench in hopes to eliminate this issue.
