# 08/29/16-Pleasant Surprise

Last week we checked on the bees to see if they were moving up into the top super. While there was a decent amount of ladies hanging out at the top we didn't see half the numbers that the bottom box had on each frame. Comb had been drawn from the frames but only a few frames actually held honey. It was obvious the queen had not ventured up.

Barely a week later, I was quiet shocked to find rows of defensive bees lined between the frames. Quite a bit has happened in about 6 days. Peering down into the frames it seems just as many ladies now fill the the top frames as the bottom. Tomorrow, I will perform a full hive inspection once the majority of the scavengers are out to examine just how successful.
