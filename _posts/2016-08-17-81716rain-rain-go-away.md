8/17/16---Rain Rain Go Away

It has been dark and dreary all week. The bees are not loving the weather. This week was the first time I have ever seen all the bees actually go inside their hive in the evening. Typically with the warmer Texas nights a large amount of foragers will spend the night out on the front of the box in order to keep the hive from over heating. This week I found when the sky is clear the bees slowly will start to come out and hang on the outside of their boxes. When it begins to fill with clouds the bees will make their ways into the hives. Bees detect moisture in the air with their antennas and will seek shelter impending rain.
