Checked our sticky boards again after another 3 day run. The good news the white hive has not had an increase in mite population at all and with the growing number of bees the mite to bee ratio is becoming much better.

Now for the bad. The Wood hive has now tested at the same rate as White. Last weeks read was either a bad read or we have a growing population within the Wood Hive. Both hives will be relieving a drench of honey be tomorrow when we open up the hives. In addition beetle traps will also be placed.
