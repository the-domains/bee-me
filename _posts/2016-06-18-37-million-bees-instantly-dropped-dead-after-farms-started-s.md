  It's no secret that bees are extremely important for the health of the
  environment and for humans, although this fact is not well-known and not taken
  seriously enough. Bees are estimated to pollinate one-sixth of all flowering
  plants in the world and are responsible for the continued success of about 400
  agricultural plants.
