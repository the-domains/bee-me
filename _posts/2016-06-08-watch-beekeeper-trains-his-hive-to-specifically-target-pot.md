  France - A French beekeeper using the moniker Nicolas Trainerbees claims to
  have trained a hive of honeybees he calls "canna-bees" to produce honey from
  marijuana. After several years of attempting to combine his love of beekeeping
  and weed, he eventually got his army of bees to feast upon his flowering
  cannabis plants - although he refuses to expose the secret of how he does this
  - to create what he calls "cannahoney."
