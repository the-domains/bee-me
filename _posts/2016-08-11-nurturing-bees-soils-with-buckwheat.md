  By William Scheick Contributing Editor The communal complexity and
  environmental essentialness of bees have always fascinated me. As the number
  of honey and native bees has disturbingly dwindled during recent years as a
  result of diseases, various "cides" and habitat losses, my interest in them
  has only deepened (see "Beeing in the Garden," Texas Gardener, March-April
  2008).
