Sticky boards place yesterday. Tons of activity around dusk last night and tonight.

Huge increase in activity in the White Hive after supplementing Honey B Healthy two weeks in a row. In addition I sprayed the bees that were bearding on the outside last night with the relaxation/drench recipe. Really seeing a great response to the supplementation.
