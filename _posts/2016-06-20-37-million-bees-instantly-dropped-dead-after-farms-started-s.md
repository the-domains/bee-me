      There's an unbreachable divide between advocates of modern conventional
      agriculture and, essentially, everyone else, from the mainstream (organic,
      local, anti-GMO) to the less-so (biodynamics, permaculture, agroforestry).
      The parties are entrenched, the tone is partisan. But I think we ought to
      be able to get along, because all hard-core advocates of this or that food
      philosophy have two things in common: They're paying attention, and
      they're wrong.

  It's no secret that bees are extremely important for the health of the
  environment and for humans, although this fact is not well-known and not taken
  seriously enough. Bees are estimated to pollinate one-sixth of all flowering
  plants in the world and are responsible for the continued success of about 400
  agricultural plants.
