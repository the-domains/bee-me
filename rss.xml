            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Pesticide Industry Lobbied to Push Profits Instead of Protect Bees</h1><p>(CommonDreams) Despite the abundance of scientific studies documenting the rapid and dangerous decline of pollinator populations, state and federal lawmakers have yet to pass any meaningful protections for bees. The reason, according to the findings of a new investigation, is that pesticide giants such as Bayer, Monsanto, and Syngenta have deployed an aggressive lobbying campaign to dilute and suppress attempts to regulate their multi-billion dollar industry-with great success.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4bcb833385edac72213630dff24601a5/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.undergroundreporter.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Fhoney-bee.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Chemicals manufactured by Bayer Corporation have contributed to CCD (Colony Collapse Disorder). The bees have been poisoned with a known insect neurotoxin called Clothianidin, a pesticide manufactured by Bayer, which has been clearly linked to massive bee die offs in Germany and France.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/01f8b5f724fb0ad266f3a1e898ebd1d24582e4e7.jpg"></article>]]></description>
