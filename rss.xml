            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Pesticide Industry Lobbied to Push Profits Instead of Protect Bees</h1><p>(CommonDreams) Despite the abundance of scientific studies documenting the rapid and dangerous decline of pollinator populations, state and federal lawmakers have yet to pass any meaningful protections for bees. The reason, according to the findings of a new investigation, is that pesticide giants such as Bayer, Monsanto, and Syngenta have deployed an aggressive lobbying campaign to dilute and suppress attempts to regulate their multi-billion dollar industry-with great success.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4bcb833385edac72213630dff24601a5/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.undergroundreporter.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Fhoney-bee.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Bees are estimated to pollinate one-sixth of all flowering plants in the world and are responsible for the continued success of about 400 agricultural plants.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/7d540effc07914d42e1b74cc75c87e73/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fta1.universaltelegra.netdna-cdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Fbees1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
